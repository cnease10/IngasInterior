                Hi there, I'm Inga. I'm an interior designer who loves all things fashion. 
                You can check out my blog <a href="ingasBlog">here</a>. <br/> I would love to turn your 
                world upside down (I have a flair for the dramatic) by taking you an adventure into 
                light, space, color, and eye-catching pieces.
